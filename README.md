## 'Are we just pretending to apply the GDPR?' anecdote
You work a mundane office job in your city. However, after getting sick of all the *gossip* amongst your coworkers and the *countless headache-inducing deadlines*, you decide to apply to another similar, but better paying job. **Magically**, your application is successful, such that you are going to be leaving your current job the following week. 

In your last friday at the job, while going through reports, daydreaming about your future, ***Executive Manager Darcy*** comes to your desk. **'Great, another rant about his boss and literally everyone in this office'**, you think to yourself.

Much to your surprise, he whispers to you, congratulating you on 'leaving this deadbeat place', and subtly hands you a paper. Confused, you thank him and ask what it is.

*'A little last project for you, considering it's your last day. And a little tool for me.'*, Darcy answered with a smirk.

**'And what do I get out of it?'**, you say, raising your eyebrow, thinking that you really weren't getting paid enough for this bullshit.

*'Justice.'*

Curious, you open up his crumbled paper and start reading.

## The Task
Build a Python application capable of merging two databases: one containing codes and tasks corresponding to each code (the one that I, Darcy, have access to), and one containing employees and their codes (a database that was easy to access thanks to our company's poor data protection). The application must be able to show me who each task belongs to and statistics about task completion. I must be the only one able to access the app, and it should work properly with the given sets of data. Thanks.

**'I mean, this really shouldn't be hard to manage, but why do YOU need it?'**, you ask, intrigued.

*'Maybe you'll find out at the right time.'*, Darcy mouths before going to get his 4th coffee of the day. 

While opening up Pycharm, you think to yourself that he's been acting weird, but since it's your last task and you're kinda bored, you decide to do it anyways.

## Three weeks later...

... you get a call. Unknown Caller ID. You decide not to answer, but you get a message to voicemail anyways:

**'Yo. Thanks for that app. I printed those results out and glued them on all of our doors. A few people, such as Blossom and Clay from financial weren't really happy about being exposed in front of everyone that they weren't really doing much. But, overall, the pretended perfection of our firm simply imploded with employees angry at their data being out, at our bosses for the unfair distribution of chores, and the list goes on. Resignation after resignation, trial threat after trial threat, the firm decided to dissolute. How am I not concerned that they could find out? Pretty easy. They couldn't even figure out who did it, and how the data got out. So don't worry about it being traced back to any of us, really.'**

You feel a shiver going down your back. However, it's as if the voice on the phone could tell what you were about to ask.

**'Now, why would I do this? Haha.**  
  
**Man, I don't know. I just like seeing the world burn sometimes. See you in hell!'** the voicemail ended in a joyful click.

You think for a while, shrug, and then get back to work at your new and shiny job.
